# Interactive WebGL Image Gallery with Magnifying Glass Effect using GLSL shaders.

## Overview

This project is a **React + Vite** application that displays a **gallery of images** over which a **magnifying glass effect** is applied using **WebGL and GLSL shaders**. The magnifying glass enlarges and distorts the images below it, including a **chromatic-aberration and distortion effect**, providing a visually striking interactive gallery experience.

A WebGL-powered magnifying glass follows the cursor, creating a **zoomed, distorted view** with chromatic aberration.

- **300 images** arranged in a pseudo-random grid.
- **Magnifying glass** with GLSL shaders:
  - Zoom and distortion
  - Chromatic aberration effect
- **Smooth camera pan** following mouse movement.

## Features

- React components:
  - `ImagesGallery`: generates the image grid.
  - `WebGLCanvas`: renders the magnifying glass effect using WebGL shaders.
- Custom hooks:
  - `useWebGLCanvas`: manages shaders, uniforms, RAF loop.
  - `useTextureRenderer`: converts DOM images into WebGL texture.
  - `useMouse`: smooth mouse tracking.
  - `useShaders`: provides vertex and fragment shaders.
  - `useWebGLProgram`: shader compilation and program linking.

---

## Architecture

- **App** – Root component that manages the reference to the gallery container.
- **ImagesGallery** – Renders the gallery of images and exposes a container reference for WebGL rendering.
- **WebGLCanvas** – Renders a `<canvas>` using WebGL and applies GLSL shaders for the magnifying glass effect.
- **Custom Hooks** – Utilities that manage shaders, textures, mouse input, and WebGL program creation.

---

## Usage

- Move the mouse over the gallery to see the magnifying glass follow the cursor.

- The magnifying glass dynamically enlarges and distorts the images underneath with chromatic aberration effects.

- Resize the browser to see responsive behavior.

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Partial rendering: Only images visible in the viewport are drawn into the WebGL texture.

- Uniform & attribute caching: GLSL uniforms and attributes are cached to avoid redundant WebGL calls each frame.

- Smooth mouse easing: Prevents jittery movement while maintaining responsiveness.

- RAF cleanup: All requestAnimationFrame loops and event listeners are properly cleaned up to avoid memory leaks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern JavaScript toolchain built for high-performance web applications, real-time GLSL rendering, and efficient image processing.

### Frontend

-**React 19** — UI library used to build dynamic and reactive components.

- **React DOM 19** — Integrates React with the browser DOM for rendering.

-**Vite** — Next-generation frontend tooling providing ultra-fast bundling and HMR.

- **@vitejs/plugin-react** — Enables optimized React support in Vite.

### Graphics & Rendering

- **vite-plugin-glsl** — Allows importing GLSL shader files directly into JavaScript/React, enabling custom visual effects such as chromatic aberration and image distortions.

### Image Processing

-**_Sharp_** — High-performance image processing library used for transformations, optimizations, and generating efficient output images.

### Performance & Loading

-**vite-plugin-preload** — Preloads assets for improved performance and faster render times.
